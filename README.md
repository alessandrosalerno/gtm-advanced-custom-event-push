A Google Tag Manager Custom Tag Template to push custom events and structured data to the dataLayer. It supports features like data type conversion and the creation of nested objects and arrays via dot notation.

## Features

-   **Flexible Event & Data Pushing**: Easily configure and push any event along with a custom set of structured data parameters.
-   **Data Type Handling**: Specify whether your data is a `String`, `Number`, or `Boolean` or use "Inherit" to preserve the original type from the data source.
-   **Dot Notation Support**: Create complex nested objects and arrays directly from the UI by using dot notation in parameter names (e.g., `ecommerce.items.0.item_name`).
