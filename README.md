# GTM Advanced Custom Event Push

A GTM template that pushes custom events and structured data by dynamically constructing dataLayer objects, offering explicit control over data types and nesting via dot notation.

---
## Features

-   **Flexible Event & Data Pushing**: Easily configure and push any event along with a custom set of structured data parameters.
-   **Data Type Handling**: Specify whether your data is a `String`, `Number`, or `Boolean` or use "Inherit" to preserve the original type from the data source.
-   **Dot Notation Support**: Create complex nested objects and arrays directly from the UI by using dot notation in parameter names (e.g., `ecommerce.items.0.item_name`).

    -   **Event Parameters Table**:
        -   **Variable**: The key for your data point. Dot notation is supported (e.g., `ecommerce.value`, `ecommerce.items.0.price`).
        -   **Value**: The value for your data point. You can type a static value or insert a GTM Variable.
        -   **Data Type**: Specify the data type for the value.
            -   **Inherit from Variable**: (Default) preserve the original type from the data source.
            -   **String/Number/Boolean**: Forces the value to be converted and validated as the selected type.
-   **Advanced Settings**
    -   **Use a custom Data Layer name**: Enable this if your website's Data Layer variable is not named "dataLayer". **Note**: After saving, you must manually update the tag's "Accesses Globals" permission to include your custom Data Layer name.
    -   **Enable Debug Mode**: Check this to see detailed raw and processed data logs in the browser's console during testing.
